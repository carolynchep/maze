# Solving Mazes Using Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, & A*

**BFS**

**Breadth-First Search** is an algorithm that searches a tree data structure for a node by exploring all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the next depth level, used in a
queue. 

In a maze:

Searches the closest
elements to the starting
location are searched first
and finds the shortest
solution path

Finds the shortest path in
terms of actions only but
not necessarily the
least-cost path

**DFS**

**Depth- First-Search** is an
algorithm for traversing
tree or graph data
structures using the stack

DFS in maze:

From the current position,
the algorithm first explores N,S,E,W
positions and evaluates
whether the positions are
blocked and already
explored.

It also records
its parent and from the
current position, all the
potential next position is
pushed onto the stack.


The new current position
is popped from the stack
and evaluated again until
the goal is reached.

**A***

**A* algorithm** is an an
informed search
algorithm that uses the
priorityqueue.

A* aims to find a path to
the goal having the
smallest cost

g(n) is the cost from start to the goal

h(n) is the estimated cost
calculated by the
Euclidian or the
Manhattan distance
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

A* Algorithm works by
vertices in the graph,
which start with the
objectâ€™s starting point and
then repeatedly examines
the next unexamined
vertex, adding its vertices
to the set of vertices that
will be examined.
